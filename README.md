Check out my latest project!
This is a platform where you can see works of art from some of the world's most important museums.

# https://se-exihibition-platform-git-main-nadimchatelliers-projects.vercel.app/

Otherwise if you wish to run the app yourself, you will need to create a .env with the appropriate API key for Harvard's Art galleries, if you wish to obtain a key then feel free to follow the instructions under this link: 

# https://harvardartmuseums.org/collections/api

once that is obtained create a .env.local file inside of the launchpad-project directory, inside of which you will need to paste the following variable as well as your API key:

NEXT_PUBLIC_HARVARD_API_KEY="--- API KEY GOES HERE ---"



Then follow the instructions to run this on your own machine:
