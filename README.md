Check out my latest project!
This is a platform where you can see works of art from some of the world's most important museums.

Currently a work in progress, but if you are curious to check it out, I have it hosted on vercel!

otherwise if you wish to run the app yourself, feel free to clone the repository and follow the steps inside the launchpad project directory
